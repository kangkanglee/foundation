It's obviously a simple and easy way to develop software with Visual Studio of Microsoft. However ,there are some light and elegent tools which will provide unbelievable convenience.
The development tools and environmets which I love are listed as follow:

> * Linux - open operating system
> * Vi - text editor
> * markdown - a tool to organize words in a easy way
